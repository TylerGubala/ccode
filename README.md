# Getting Started
## Cloning

Clone the repository by clicking the clone or download button on Github and selecting the appropriate option.
If you are using git bash or VsCode you can enter the Http that is given at the cone button for the Command Git:Clone

If you want to keep your python global installation clean, then in VsCode you can just run the Task called "dev-init", which will create a new venv for you that won't be committed to the repo.

If you actaully want to install it on your global python installation, just do the "init" task.

## Contributing
I'm just using Visual Studio Code and the Python extension. It has Auto pep8, which makes sure that the code is well formatted and I reccomend the one and the same.

Create a new branch named something meaningful for the feature you wish to add and I'll help along the migration path
